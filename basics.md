# Basics

## why go

- fast (unlike python)
- simple type system (unlike java)
- fast compile (unlike c/c++) [1]
- native concurrency & multithreading (unlike above) [2]
- good community

## nature of go

Strong typed (variable types can't change over time)
Statically typed (variables defined at compile time) [3]
Garbage collected
Compiled into single binary (easy versioning)

[1]: c/c++ compilers are not optimized for high memory thus slow compile times
[2]: Java, python and c/c++ have been patched for concurrency (not natively supported)
[3]: There are exceptions
